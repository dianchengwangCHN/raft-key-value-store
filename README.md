# raft-key-value-store
This is the course project of MIT 6.824 Distributed Systems. This project is a distributed key-value store based on the **Raft** consensus algorithm developed in **GoLang**. It is implemented to support concurrent requests utilizing **Mutex**, **Channel**, and **Goroutine**. It is tested under a simulated environment, which covers the circumstances such as network loss, network partition, and partial cluster down.

## Lab 2: Raft Consensus Algorithm
